# Movie Poster Analysis
This is a project page for GCT675, <CulturoInformatics: Theory and Applications>, 2021 fall semester.
Using Beautiful Soup (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) **imdb_scraper.py** scrapes the poster image and basic information of the movies.
Face recognition was done with PAZ (https://github.com/oarriaga/paz) modules.
You can see some of the observations and results, visualizations in **Analyzing IMDb Movie Posters.pdf**.
